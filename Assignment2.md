2. Prepare Your Program
Open or create a new file for your program. For example, create a main.py file with the following content:
python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def main():
    x = 5
    y = 7
    result = add(x, y)
    print(f"The result is {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

Watch Expressions

Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through the code.
Variables View

The Variables panel displays the current value of all variables in the current scope.
Call Stack

The Call Stack panel shows the function call stack at any point during execution, helping you understand the flow of your program.
Step Controls

Use the step controls to navigate through your code:
Continue (F5): Resume program execution.
Step Over (F10): Execute the next line of code, stepping over function calls.
Step Into (F11): Step into a function call to debug inside it.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Step out of the current function.
Integrated Terminal

The integrated terminal allows you to interact with your program and the environment while debugging.

sh
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
c. Push Changes
Push your commits to the GitHub repository:
sh
Copy code
git push -u origin master
For the first push, -u origin master sets the upstream branch. For subsequent pushes, you can use just git push.
